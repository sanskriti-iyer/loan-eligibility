# loan-eligibility
This project develops a machine learning model to predict loan eligibility based on applicant data. Using a combination of Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, it performs data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and model training. Key steps include:
1. Cleaning and imputing missing values for both numerical and categorical variables
2. Creating new features and applying log transformations for better distribution
3. Encoding categorical data and dropping irrelevant features
4. Training and evaluating models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests
5. Applying cross-validation and tuning hyperparameters for performance optimization
6. Exporting the best model using pickle for future inference
